A chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an AI-powered application designed to understand, process, and respond to human language in a conversational manner. By leveraging NLP techniques such as tokenization, intent recognition, named entity recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis, these chatbots can interpret user inputs and generate meaningful responses. They utilize machine learning models, including deep learning architectures like transformers (e.g., GPT, BERT), to enhance their accuracy and contextual understanding. NLP chatbots are widely used in customer support, virtual assistants, e-commerce, healthcare, and education, providing automated and intelligent interactions. With continuous learning and integration capabilities, they improve over time, making them valuable tools for enhancing user engagement and efficiency in various domains.
